                    We are taking this opportunity to let you
                     take advantage of this service where we bring farmers and consumers on one platform.
                     The consumers are supposed to get quality chicken from vast number of our farmers. 
                     We also provide the farmers an opportunity to register and become our vendors where we pay them. 
                     Also we do deliveries of raw chicken or fried ones too. lastly, 
                        we give lesson to consumers to learn how to cook different varieties of 
                        recipes that we have on our schedules.</p>
